# DSProg

This is a minimal example, originally by ndsdev forum user nin-kuuku:
<https://forums.nesdev.org/viewtopic.php?t=22936>

The work by nin-kuuku (`DSProg.zip`) contains the needed programs for Windows.
Here, instead, are instructions on how to set it up in Arch Linux.



# Resource Directory

Here the binaries (`fasmarm` and `ndstool`) needed to make the rom are
included.
Everything *should* just work by running `make rom`.
The remainder of this contains instructions for setting up the needed tools 
on an Arch system^[Only tested on Manjaro. It's close enough.].



# FASMARM

FASMARM is a version of FASM (flat assembler) which cross-compiles ARM assembly 
on an x86 machine: <https://arm.flatassembler.net>



# NdsTool (DevkitPro)
